        <li>The beginning represents the passengers boarding the ship - bright and hopeful, with countless dreams.</li>
        <li>The intermission begins right after the ship hits the iceberg. We wanted a feeling of panic, danger, and a
          sense of rush.</li>
        <li>The show ends on a melancholic note, and there are accounts of passengers on lifeboats remembering the dark,
          starry sky they saw as the ship sank because they were in the middle of the sea on a moonless night. We wanted
          to replicate this and create a mood for introspection and quiet stillness.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>We plan to change the <b>lighting, visuals, and soundscapes</b> through these three parts of the experience:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We plan to have a bright and sunny pre-show, symbolising the luggage being boarded onto the ship, and the
          sounds of seagulls and shipyards.</li>
        <li>During the intermission, we plan to use ocean floor gobos and theatrical lighting to create a blue tinged
          effect, fog machines and cooling the room down, and harsh lighting to represent warning signals. The
          soundscape is going to be unsettling, with the ship creaking ominously, and water splashing precariously.</li>
        <li>Our post-show will be quiet and reflective, an almost dark stillness. We expect the audience to be quiet and
          thoughtful at the end of the performance, and want the environment to be eerily unsettling, and yet calm. The
          soundscape would be silent, either with no sound playing, or using noise-cancelling effects to make it more
          unsettling.</li>
      </ul>-->

            As the user walks past a luggage station, a motion sensor detects their presence and the trunk opens, with a
            programmed light tracing the outlines of the props inside, encouraging them to interact with it. We would
            use
            directional speakers to play an audio recording of the character narrating, also triggered by the motion
            sensor.
            <br><br>The guests can explore the props inside - rift through the characters' clothing, read their diaries
            and letters,
            examine their possessions, and thereby understand and empathise with their stories.

      <ul>
        <li><b>Helped us finalize characters -</b> Our client and us had different ideas on whether we should be using
          characters from the musical or shine the spotlight on ones that weren't featured. Building a user journey map
          made us understand how using new characters would distract the guests from both, our experience, as well as
          our clients, as they would expect to see these characters in the musical, and also exit during the
          intermission and search for an interesting character they had seen on stage.</li>
        <li>We wanted <b>means to collect feedback and guage how immersed guests are</b> without having to fill feedback
          forms. We thought of a hanging net of messages in bottles exhibit, where we got feedback that it was not
          period-accurate. We moved on to a postcard exhibit, as the ship was also a mailing ship, but faculty feedback
          told us that people would not really write a postcard. We then took inspiration from the ship's Marconi room,
          and made our own version of their telegram system, and took the liberty to make it voice-enabled.</li>

        <li><b>Playtesting</b> this idea, we realised that guests would feel freer to talk if they knew what they said
          was anonymous, so we tried iterating different modifcations - messages appearing randomly, new ones showing up
          later, multiple existing messages, until we finally came up with wave-like visuals of messages flowing
          together, forming an ocean. These were only possible through user-reseach, playtesting, and frequest

      <p style="text-align: center"><i>Testing with (1)magnetic sensors and (2)copper strips as a conductor, to detect
          when the earpieces are picked up vs. put down</i></p>
      <br>
      <p>Using the copper strips helped us solve the issue of ensuring people always put down the earpiece in the correct orientation for it to count as "closed" and for the audio to stop. Now, the earpiece can be spun anyway you want, and only reads as "open" when it is lifted up off the holder.</p>
